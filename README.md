### Instructions, for nerds

Darkstar is written such that a lot of the core settings and assets are easily user-modifiable. Sprites are stored as .png files, and most configs are stored as .txt files. All of these assets are stored in a single folder. This makes making your own assets, or downloading new assets easy. All you need to do is to replace a single folder.
